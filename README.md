# Disease Sentinel: Exploring Nigeria’s Disease Reporting System (2013 and 2015)

This project explores Nigeria's disease surveillance data from 2013 and 2015, covering 48 diseases across 747 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 36 states (Excluding Adamawa). It uses SQL for data analysis and Power BI for dynamic storytelling, focusing on health trends, seasonal spikes, and reporting gaps.

## Why It Matters

This dashboard was built to make complex disease data understandable for everyone. It shows where Nigeria’s healthcare reporting shines — and where it breaks down. I hope it encourages more public conversations around health data transparency and planning.
